# bootstrap-a-la-carte
## Pick and choose different bootsrap components

### User Stories

1. User should be able to select from a list of bootsrap components and be able to copy to the clipboard
2. There should be a preview of the component in the window with the code to go along with it

### Future Versions

3. The browser should remember the users' clipboard for easier copying and pasting, maybe even use checkboxes to select multiple components and then provide a "checkout" page with all of their choices
4. Certain components should have the option to customize (eg. Choosing different options for the navbar like including a search bar or choosing the theme)
5. Include other bootstrap options like CSS and JS
6. Choose different Themes for CSS
